Mary Jo's Performing Arts Academy is celebrating over 40 years as a top performing arts studio. Offering a comprehnsive performing arts curriculum, MJPAA came to us to refresh their online presence and capture more student registrations online.

We built an adaptive and responsive website with maintainability in mind. The website provides enough flexibility for staff to make weekly updates to classes, programs, and curriculum, while encouring students to register online with ease.

#### Objectives

- Increase student registrations
- Ability for staff to easily maintain classes, curriculum, and all content
- Provide easy way for students to search and register for classes
- Work great on mobile and on-the-go

#### Work Involved
