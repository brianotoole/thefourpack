Water Street Tampa will create 2 million square feet of new office space, including downtown Tampa's first new office towers in nearly 25 years. The project, led by Strategic Property Partners, will provide a vibrant vision for the future of Tampa and for the 23,000+ people who live, work, study, and visit each day.

The JW Marriott Tampa will be the cultural focal point of the Water Street Tampa neighborhood.
