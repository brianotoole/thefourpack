The American Chemistry Council engaged us to create a safe space for moms to discuss cleaning and disinfection. This community became well known through social media and eventually.... the website. The website features a regularly updated blog with original articles, free downloadable posters and coloring pages, and ways to advocate for the safe and effective use of disinfection products, including bleach.

#### Objectives

- Create an engaging blog website with ability to manage many category types of content.
- Easy to use on mobile
- Generate an increase in traffic and awareness of cleaning and disinfection products

#### Work Involved

We helped with strategy for user experience, technology selection, and web development for the redesign of the Mom's Against Cooties website. The site was built mobile-first and uses a content management system.

#### Takeaway

_Mommy-bloggers_ are very engaging! There are more than 15,000+ visits per month and most of the traffic is via social media, due to the high amount of shares / conversation.
